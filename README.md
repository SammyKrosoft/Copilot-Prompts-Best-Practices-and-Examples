# Copilot Prompting Schema

**GOAL**: *WHAT* DO I WANT
> ```
> Give me 4-5 bullet points - the only mandatory part of the structure.
> The other ones makes Copilot / AI answers give more specific, taylored answers.
> ```

**CONTEXT**: FOR WHAT - which media, which audience ?
> ```
> for me to use in a presentation
> ```
**SOURCE**: *FROM* WHICH SOURCE - database, CSV, Excel workbook or table, Word page, Power BI page or visual, ...
```
from the Copilot email I sent last week
```
**EXPECTATION**: WHAT TYPE OF RESPONSE - tone (persuasive, poetic, formal, technical, 
```
Make them easy to understand and short
```

# Best practices

- Be detailed
- Use positive instructions ("what I want" vs "what I don't want")
- Structure your prompts (Goal / Context / Source / Expectations)
- Edit and regenerate (rephrase, change structure, and try again)

# Notes

Sometimes the source is the application we are using Copilot in (Power BI, Word/Excel/Powerpoint document, ...)
You can be more specific within a source, for example in Power BI:
- What are the top 5 sellers from the pie chart
